# rhado-histo-fed

This project contains a federated machine learning application that does sarcoma classification based on histopathology slides. We use [NVIDIA NVFlare](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare) to federate the application.

The initial idea (and code) came from [DeepPATH](https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH)
